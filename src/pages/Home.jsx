            Hi there! My name is Eber, Im a frontend developer. I been developing my skills for the
            past two years now, and I think Im ready for the next step. I enjoy working with react,
            I love it. My firsts steps were in the ux world where I learn the fundamentals about
            design and user experience, the desire to bring projects to life led me to learn how to
            program.
            <br />
            Recently I finish a fullsatck project where I have the lucky to work with a great team
            and to be introduce to new things like team work and stuff like data bases, set up a
            server and structure and work on a project with good practices.
            <br />
            <Link color={'black'} fontWeight="bold" to="/writtings" as={RouterLink}>
              I wanted to make this introduction brief so as not to bore. I wrote in a more extended
              version about my process of becoming a developer in case you are interested in reading
              some more paragraphs.
